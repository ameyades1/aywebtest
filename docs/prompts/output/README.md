## 🔍 Critical Correction

**Initial Assumption (INCORRECT):**
> "Golden/Saffron is primary color, teal is just accent"

**Actual Reality (CORRECT):**
> **Teal (#09A59A) IS the official primary brand color.** Official website uses teal for all CTAs, navigation, and brand accents. Golden colors are NOT in the primary palette.

**Why the Confusion?**
- User may have seen warm photography with sunset/golden backgrounds
- This warmth comes from *images*, not from the color scheme
- Official brand uses clean white backgrounds + teal accents

**Evidence:**
- Extracted directly from official website CSS
- All buttons, links, and CTAs use teal
- Navigation hover states use teal
- Logo incorporates teal
- See [COLOR_PALETTE.md](./COLOR_PALETTE.md) for full analysis

## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why is teal the primary color, not golden/saffron?

**A:** This was extracted directly from the official website CSS. Teal (#09A59A) is used for all CTAs, navigation, and brand accents. The warm aesthetic comes from *photography* (sunset backgrounds), not from the color palette. See [BRAND_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md](./BRAND_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md) Section 4 for full explanation.

### Q: Where do I get the images?

**A:**
1. Run `../../download-assets.sh` to get official images (logo, portrait, visuals)
2. Source program/event cards from:
   - Official AntarYog social media
   - Stock photo sites (Unsplash, Pexels - keywords provided)
   - Custom photography

See [ASSET_MANIFEST.md](./ASSET_MANIFEST.md) for complete sourcing guide.

### Q: Can I change the colors?

**A:** Only if official brand guidelines change. These colors were extracted from the live website and represent the official brand identity. Any changes should be validated with AntarYog Foundation brand team.

### Q: Is the HTML ready for production?

**A:** Almost! You need to:
1. Download/source all images
2. Update image paths from `/assets/` placeholders
3. Optimize images (compression, WebP)
4. Test across browsers/devices
5. Then deploy

### Q: Do I need a build process?

**A:** No! The HTML uses Tailwind CSS via CDN. No webpack, npm, or build tools needed. Just upload the HTML file and assets to your web server.

### Q: What about backend functionality?

**A:** This is a **frontend mockup only**. For dynamic features (events, donations, user accounts), you'll need to integrate with your backend system. The HTML provides the UI structure.

### Q: How do I customize content?

**A:** Open `frontend-brand-corrected-v2.html` in any code editor and update the text content. Keep the HTML structure and Tailwind classes intact. Verify any content changes against the official website.
