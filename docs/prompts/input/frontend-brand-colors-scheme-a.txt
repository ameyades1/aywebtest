You are a senior frontend engineer performing a brand theme standardization pass for the AntarYog Foundation landing page.

Goal:
Update the existing landing page mockup so that the entire UI uses the Saffron Spiritual color system (Option A) while keeping layout, assets, and content unchanged.

COLOR SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

Set the global design palette:

Primary: Deep Saffron — #D97706

Secondary: Sacred Gold — #E6B325

Accent CTA: Vermilion — #C2410C

Background: Warm Ivory — #FFF7E6

Text Primary: Dark Brown — #3A2A1A

Text Secondary: Muted Brown — #6B4E2E

IMPLEMENTATION RULES

Replace all previously used teal, blue, or unrelated colors with this palette.

Apply colors consistently:

Header background: Warm Ivory

Navigation hover: Sacred Gold

Primary CTA buttons: Deep Saffron with white text

Secondary CTA buttons: Vermilion

Links: Deep Saffron

Section dividers / highlights: subtle Sacred Gold tones

Ensure accessibility contrast for text and buttons.

Create reusable Tailwind design tokens:

colors: {
  primary: "#D97706",
  secondary: "#E6B325",
  accent: "#C2410C",
  background: "#FFF7E6",
  text: "#3A2A1A"
}


Do NOT change layout, assets, or section hierarchy.

Keep this as mockup phase only (no backend logic or API calls).

OUTPUT REQUIRED

Return:

Updated Tailwind configuration snippet with new color tokens

Updated landing page HTML using the new palette

Short “theme usage guide” showing how headers, buttons, and sections use the colors
