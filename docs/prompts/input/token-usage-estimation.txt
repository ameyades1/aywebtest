User Prompt: Token Usage Estimation and Optimization

Request:
I want to estimate token usage before large tasks. Can you suggest ways, including but not limited to prefix prompts, skills etc to estimate and save token usage for any prompt?

Context:
- Working on AntarYog Foundation website project
- Using Claude Code (Haiku 4.5 model)
- Current token usage: ~33k/200k (16%)
- Need to plan large implementation tasks efficiently
- Want to maximize output per token spent

Goal:
Provide practical strategies and techniques to:
1. Estimate token usage before starting tasks
2. Optimize token consumption for large projects
3. Use tools, skills, memory, and planning effectively
4. Create reusable patterns to save tokens in future sessions
