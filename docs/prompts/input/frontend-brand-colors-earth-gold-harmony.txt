You are a senior frontend engineer performing a brand theme standardization pass for the AntarYog Foundation landing page.

Goal:
Update the existing landing page mockup so that the entire UI uses the Earth-Gold Harmony color system (Option v5) while keeping layout, assets, and content unchanged.

COLOR SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

Set the global design palette:

Primary: Brand Brown — #6B3E2E
Secondary: Soft Gold — #D9A441
Accent CTA: Copper — #B45309
Background Main: Warm Cream — #F6F1E7
Alternate Section Background: Soft Sand — #EFE6D6
Text Primary: Deep Brown — #3A2418
Text Secondary: Muted Earth — #6E5C4F

IMPLEMENTATION RULES

Replace all previously used teal, blue, or saffron-dominant colors with this palette.

Apply colors consistently:

Header background: Warm Cream
Navigation hover: Soft Gold
Primary CTA buttons: Brand Brown with white text
Secondary CTA buttons: Copper
Links: Brand Brown
Section alternate backgrounds: Soft Sand
Section dividers / highlights: subtle Soft Gold tones

Ensure accessibility contrast for text and buttons.

Create reusable Tailwind design tokens:

colors: {
  primary: "#6B3E2E",
  secondary: "#D9A441",
  accent: "#B45309",
  background: "#F6F1E7",
  sectionAlt: "#EFE6D6",
  text: "#3A2418"
}


Do NOT change layout, assets, or section hierarchy.

Keep this as mockup phase only (no backend logic or API calls).

OUTPUT REQUIRED

Return:

• Updated Tailwind configuration snippet with new color tokens
• Updated landing page HTML using the new palette
• Short “theme usage guide” showing how headers, buttons, and sections use the colors
