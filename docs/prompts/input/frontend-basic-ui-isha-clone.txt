You are a senior UX designer and frontend architect.

Goal:
Create a **landing page user journey mockup (UI wireframe only, not functional)** for the **Antaryog Foundation** website.
The page must use **Antaryog branding, content themes, and colors**, but **layout inspiration should follow the structure and sectioning style of isha.sadhguru.org**.

This is only the **Phase-1 wireframe implementation**.
All sections should contain **placeholder content and placeholder links**, since full features will be implemented later.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES

* Clean spiritual aesthetic, calm typography, sacred geometric accents.
* Large hero sections and modular scroll-based storytelling.
* Every section must include:

  * Section Title
  * Short placeholder description
  * CTA button (placeholder link)
* Responsive layout ready (desktop-first wireframe).
* Navigation must support future expansion into many programs and courses.

   * CTA: "Know More"

3. Paths Offered

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return:

1. Landing page wireframe hierarchy (section-by-section)
2. Navigation sitemap (future scalable)
3. Component list (hero, cards, CTA blocks, sliders, etc.)
4. Placeholder copy text for each section
5. Tailwind-based HTML skeleton layout (no functionality)

Do NOT implement backend logic.
Do NOT implement real API calls.
This is a structure-only design for future phased implementation.

COLOR & STYLE GUIDANCE

* Use warm saffron / gold accents
* Light background tones
* Calm serif headings + readable sans-serif body
